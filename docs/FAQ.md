## To which scrum events must the product owner attend? (e.g. Sprint Review)

## Do we need a release plan?

## How much software documentation is needed?

## What are the project stakeholders?

## What is meant by "Bash-Skript mit der sequentiellen Komposition der letztgenannten Skript" => there is only one script described

## How should the application be deployed? I.e. are there arguments for/against Docker

## Does the application have to be a client/server where the server is hosted centrally by us or should it be self-contained self-hostable?

## "The project report [...] must contain this project description as a quotation." => where in the provided document structure does this fall?
