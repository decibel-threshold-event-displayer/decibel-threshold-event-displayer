## Product and Sprint Backlog implementation

>Discuss in your group how you want to manage and implement your Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog.

We decided to use gitlab to implement our Product and Sprint Backlog with the following attributes:
- ID
- Title / Story
- Description (Notes)
- Weight (Story Points)
- Priority with labels:
  - low
  - medium
  - high
  - impediment

## Release Plan

>Discuss in your group the need of a ‘Release Plan’ (the decision depends on the project / stakeholder).

## Impediment Backlog implementation

>Discuss in your group how you want to implement the Scrum artifact 'Impediment Backlog' in 'Project 1’. Does it make sense to keep a 'Sprint Diary’?

We will use Gitlab issues and assign the label "impediment" to keep track of the impediments, additionally we have a dedicated board which shows only this tasks.
