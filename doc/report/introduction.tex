\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Initial Situation}

According to the Federal Office for the Environment (DE: BAFU), one in seven people in Switzerland is affected by noise pollution.
The pollution comes primarily from road traffic, followed by railways and then air traffic.
In addition to these noise sources, construction sites, nightclubs and public facilities also produce noise.
Because of this, Switzerland has set limits that must be adhered to.
However, it is of course the case that these limits are not always adhered to.
Affected people must then either accept this or take action against it.
For the latter, they must first gather evidence so that they can then take action against it.
This evidence usually comes from a recording which the affected person made them self.

\subsection{Project Goal}
To help the people affected by noise pollution, we want to create an application which processes a given sound file (.wav)
and analyzes it.
It should detect when a specified threshold has been exceeded and then summarizes the result in a PDF document.
The document should then contain all necessary information for filing a complaint.
As our application will have a wide range of end users, two of our main design goals is to make it as user friendly as possible
and make it platform independent, so it can be used with any PC operating system.
