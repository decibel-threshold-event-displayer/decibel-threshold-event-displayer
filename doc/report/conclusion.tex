\section{Conclusion}
This was the first time that anyone of us has worked that much with audio files. We learned a lot about how audio overall works and how to process it. We learned especially a lot about how the wave file format or rather the riff format family works, because we implemented our own parser for that. As in every project there were some challenges we encounted in the course of the semester, but never had the feeling that we were not in control of the situation. We are pleased with how we managed the project and the outcome of the project. To implement it as webbased application was a good decision, as the user does not need to install anything and it is accessible from everwhere. This way we can reach the miximal number of potential users. We think that our application provide some real value for people affected by noice disturbance, because they have the possibility to create a full noice report with an easy to use website.

\subsection{Review}
We initialy struggled with the task of filtering the audio with a given threshold. This was due to the fact that the audio samples in wave files represent relative loudness and not absolute. And to filter the audio we need absolute values. After researching we found out that we can map the values from the samples to absolute ones when we have some reference values. 
We also had issues with the implementation of the parsing of individual samples because of the way that javascript handles numberic values. In the end we were able to fix this by using the appropriate functions to read bytes. Besides does minor difficulites, we did not encounter any issues which could endanger the achievement of our targets. 
The project management with Scrum gave a noticable overhead for the whole project and we spent a good amount of time every week to hold the scrum meetings. We think that this was a bit to much for a project of this size. But never the less it helped us to manage and prioritize our tasks and to focus on independent features to implement. 
From a documentation perspective it was the largest project that we have used latex for. We learned alot about how to setup the a document and discovered some new packages and tricks along the way. It was also the first time that we used latex instead of powerpoint for our presentation.
