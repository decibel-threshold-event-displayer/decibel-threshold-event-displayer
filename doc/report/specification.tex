\section{Specification}
The following chapter describes the system specification. The specification is derived from the requirements in the project description
as well as the discussions with the stakeholder. Assumptions and constraints are described in the following sections and were validated by
the defined product owner and the stakeholders if necessary.

\subsection{System Delimitation}
The system delimination is split into the static system environment (\ref{subsubsec:system_environment})
and the dynamic process environment (\ref{subsubsec:process_environment}).

\subsubsection{System Environment}
\label{subsubsec:system_environment}
System:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend (User interaction)
    \item LaTeX and pgfplots
\end{itemize}
System context:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stakeholder (tutor)
    \item User
    \item LÃ¤rmliga
    \item (Accurate conversion to absolute decibel)
\end{itemize}
Out of scope:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration in legal complaints
    \item (Accurate conversion to absolute decibel)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Process Environment}
\label{subsubsec:process_environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Selecting a file
    \item WAV file analysis (validation, parsing, conversion to absolute db values, threshold filtering)
    \item Plotting (LaTeX / pgfplots) and PDF generation
\end{itemize}
