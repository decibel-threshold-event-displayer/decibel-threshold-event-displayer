\subsection{Project description}\label{subsec:project-description}

The \textbf{goal (what)} of this project is to deliver a FLOSS-licensed, platform-independent piece of
software (computer program), called the \textit{Decibel Threshold Event Displayer}, that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item takes as inputs a WAV-file and a list of sound level thresholds in decibels (e.g., legal day
          and nighttime noise maxima above which your health deteriorates);
    \item filters out all data points in the file that correspond to sound events below the lowest of
          the above thresholds; and
    \item displays the remaining data points (as a blue vertical comb plot) on a horizontal time
          axis (with the dates and times corresponding to the data points) as well as the
          thresholds (as horizontal red lines) in decibel, and statistically summarises the data set
          with the help of the LaTeX-package pgfplots.
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{purpose (why)} of this project is to empower poor folks who suffer from insomnia due to
ambient noise (\url{https://laermliga.ch/}) by arming them with the (peaceful) means of proving
their noise hell (a smartphone app such as \url{https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/dezibel-x-pro-l\%C3\%A4rm-messger\%C3\%A4t/id1257651611}
together with your software) to the police and the courts of law. \\

The code should be minimal, modular, and self-explaining. \\

The project report should be concise (maximally informative, minimally long). It must contain
this project description as a quotation.
