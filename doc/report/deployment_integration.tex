\section{Deployment/Integration}
We decided to use GitHub Pages via an organization for distribution because it provides an easy way to access the
application for end users and simplifies the maintenance for developers.
The GitHub organization is located under: https://github.com/decibel-threshold-event-displayer
The application is deployed as a GitHub Page under: https://decibel-threshold-event-displayer.github.io/

% TODO: How do we build/deploy from our gitlab repository (private) to the github repository (punblic)
