\section{Deployment/Integration}
We decided to use GitHub Pages via an organization for distribution because it provides an easy way to access the
application for end users and simplifies the maintenance for developers.
The GitHub organization is located under: https://github.com/decibel-threshold-event-displayer
The application is deployed as a GitHub Page under: https://decibel-threshold-event-displayer.github.io/

\subsection{Installation Manuel \& Script}
We are using a Makefile to automate the development setup, build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages.

\subsubsection{Development setup}
A local webserver is needed work on the application as some Browsers will not execute web workers on locally served files~\cite{stackoverflow_chrome_cant_load_web_worker}.
By default, the project uses the builtin webserver of Python 3.
Python 3 can be installed with the systems package manager or by downloading it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Afterward the following command can be used to run the local webserver on http://0.0.0.0:8000/:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Makefile: Start local webserver},label={lst:makefile_start_local_webserver},language=Bash]
$ make dev
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Build}
% TODO: Describe how we build the application (mabe not needed)

\subsubsection{Deploy}
% TODO: Describe how we deploy the apllication to GitHub Pages
