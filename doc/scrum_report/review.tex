\subsection{Product goals}\label{subsec:product-goals-review}
The following list summarizes the~\ref{subsec:product-goals} Product goals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyze Audio File
    \item Summarize findings in a PDF
    \item Easy to use
\end{enumerate}

From our point off view, the first two Product goals are clearly achieved, as we built a working application
which can parse and analyze Audio Files and then summarizes the findings in a PDF document.
The third goal `Easy to use` is not as easy to measure, but we argue that this is achieved by considering the following
list of best practices:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cross platform: Achieved by building a public web application
    \item No login or other personal data required
    \item Clarity, consistency, responsiveness and familiar patterns: Achieved by using~\href{https://getbootstrap.com/2.0.2/}{Bootstrap, from Twitter}
    \item Help and documentation: Achieved with integrating tooltips where needed and show human-readable error messages
    \item Performance and fast load times: Achieved by realizing the application as a minimal SPA and preloading all necessary LaTeX resources in the background as the user is already filling out the form
\end{enumerate}
