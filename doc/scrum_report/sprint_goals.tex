\section{Sprint Goals}
The sprint goals are defined by the project team at the Sprint Planning right after the conclusion of the previous sprint.
They are formulated to be compliant with the S.M.A.R.T principles. The project team decides the sprint goals based on the backlog
priorisation and the issues assigned to the next sprint. The sprint goals are defined and reviewed in a Markdown file in the repository (\href{https://gitlab.ti.bfh.ch/decibel-threshold-event-displayer/decibel-threshold-event-displayer/-/blob/main/doc/scrum/sprints.md}{Gitlab}).
\subsection{Sprint 1}
For the first sprint, the project team decided to focus on research and prototyping. This can be understood as a feasibility study.
Due to the team's relative inexperience with LaTeX and due to the project scope, they felt that having a working prototype had to be
made before design decision could realistically be made. \\

\end{table}
In Sprint 1, the project team managed to complete the first two goals (prototyping and tech stack evaluation). However, they were unable to
evaluate the licencing because the decision, which tech stack should be used was made only at the end of the sprint. The project team als underestimated
the issue weights, leading to unreached goals.
\subsection{Sprint 2}
Sprint 2 has not ended, as of the completion date of this document. Nonetheless, two of the seven defined sprint goals have been reached at this point.
Although the project team defined more goals for the second sprint than the first, it is important to note that the total weight of tasks assigned to this
sprint is equal to the first sprint and estimates are more conservative.
