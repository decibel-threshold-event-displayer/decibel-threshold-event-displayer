\section{Scrum Roles}\label{sec:scrum_roles}
The project team has, in coordination with the tutor, determined that the association LÃ¤rmliga (\url{https://laermliga.ch/}) will not be directly involved
in the project.
Instead, the tutor Dr.\ Simon Kramer, will take on the role of the stakeholder and render the decisions to be made by the customer. \\
The other scrum roles were determined internally by the project team.
At first, the decision was made for Dr.\ Simon Kramer to also be the Product Owner.
However, the project team realized it would be impractical to include Dr.\ Simon Kramer in every product decision and especially in the prioritization of the backlog.
The project team felt that, due to their relative inexperience, it would be best to have the Product Owner in the team, so decisions could be made quickly and validated
with the stakeholders afterward, if necessary.
