\subsection{Identifying the initial situation}\label{subsec:identifying-the-initial-situation}
For identifying the initial situation we analyzed~\ref{subsec:project-description} Project Description and used multiple online resources
such as the websites of \href{https://laermliga.ch/}{Lärmliga Schweiz} and \href{https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/noise/in-brief.html}{Federal Office for the Environment FOEN}.
Based on those findings we designed our application, which now provides a convenient way for affected people to document noise pollution.

\subsection{Topic analysis}\label{subsec:topic-analysis}
The issue at hand needs some in depth knowledge about how audio recoding and measurement works.
Looking back, we should have started earlier to research and learn the basics of audio recoding and measurements.

\subsection{Stakeholder / Stakeholder Management}\label{subsec:stakeholder-management}
Initially we identified a list of possible stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tutor: Dr. Simon Kramer
    \item People affected by noise pollution
    \item Noise producers (Construction Sites, Night Clubs, Highways)
    \item Lärmliga Schweiz
    \item Federal Office for the Environment FOEN
\end{itemize}

For the context of this module we decided to only consider our tutor as the sole stakeholder,
because otherwise the stakeholder management would cost much more time without much benefit.
This way the stakeholder management turned out to be straight forward, as Dr. Kramer provided his expectations and the
scope of the project beforehand, only impediments and key decisions had to be discussed together.
